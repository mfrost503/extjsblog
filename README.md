ExtJS Grid Example

This is a little bit of code that I referenced in a blog post with a real quick and easy grid
that doesn't use any markup.  The whole grid is generated using ExtJS 3.3.0 (it was what I had on hand).

You can read the blog post [Build GUI Compositely with ExtJS](http://shortwhitebaldguy.com/blog/2012/06/build-guis-compositely-with-extjsEdit)
Ping me on twitter @mfrost503 if you find problems or have questions...

It's a pretty neat piece of software and can save time if you don't have an eye for design...
